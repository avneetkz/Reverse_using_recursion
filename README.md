# Reverse_using_recursion
This repository reverses a string entered by user by recursive approach.
The string is passed as an argument to a recursive function to reverse the string. In the function, the base condition is that if the condition is not string , the string is returned. Elses , the reverse function is recursively called to starts from the end, towards the first, taking each element. So it reverses the string and concatenate the first character to the end of the sliced string. 

## What is recursion
Recursion is a functional approach of breaking down a problem into a set of simple subproblems with an identical pattern and solving them by calling one subproblem inside another in sequential order. Python stores the results of all subproblems in temporary memory, executes some arithmetic operations (if needed), and releases the memory after the end of recursion.
